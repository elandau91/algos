//HEAPS

    //Binary Heaps
        //Very similar to Binary Search Tree but it has different rules
        //In a MaxBinaryHeap parent nodes are always larger than child nodes
        //In a MinBinaryHeap parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes
            //No order, but top to bottom differences
        //No guarantees between sibling in either case
        //Binary heaps are compact as possible, so every left and right is filled before moving down
    //Binary Heaps are used to implement priority queues, which are very common data structures
    //Binary Heaps are also used with Graph Traversal
