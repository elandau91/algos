//TREES

    //Trees are data structures that consist of nodes in a parent/child relationship
    //Lists are linear, Trees are non-linear, with multiple paths
        //Singly linked lists are like a special case of a tree
            //But if you add other branches, no longer a tree
    //Tree nodes can only point from parent to child, not from sibling to sibling (that's a graph)
    //Trees also have just ONE root entry point.
        //Root is top node in a tree
        //Child is a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
        //Parent is the converse of child
        //Siblings are groups of nodes with the same parent
        //Leaf is a node with no children
        //Edge is the connection between one node to another
    
    //Trees are common! They are seen:
        //HTML: The DOM. HTML elements on the DOM are structured in a tree
        //Network Routing: Network delivery schemes (broadcast, multicast, etc)
        //Abstract Syntax Trees: The structure of languages (while loop, parent of conditional, etc)
        //Artificial Intelligence: structuring decisions, etc
        //Folders in OS: You have folders with files in them, and other folders, like on your Mac, etc
        //JSON: Can be represented in tree structure
        
    //Types of Trees
        //Binary Trees
