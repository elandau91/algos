//Hash Tables (also known as Hash Map)

    //What is a Hash Table?
        //Hash Tables are used to store key/value pairs
        //They are like arrays but the keys are not ordered
        //They are fast! for finding, removing, searching
    //All languages use them
        //If data doesn't need on order, hash maps are preferrable
        //Python has dictionaries
        //JS has objects and maps
        //Java, Go, & Scala have Maps
        //Ruby has Hashes
    
    //This section is focused on building hashes, or objects in JS
