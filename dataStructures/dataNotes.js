//DATA STRUCTURES

    //Singly Linked Lists
        //A data structure that contains a head, tail and length
        //Linked lists consists of nodes, each node has a value and pointer to another node or null
        //They don't have indexes!
        //Connected via nodes with a next pointer
        //Random access is not allowed! If you want 10th item, you have to traverse one by one to get to 10.
        //BUT insertion and deletion are better with linked lists!
            //You don't need to worry about the time/space of re-assigning indexes
