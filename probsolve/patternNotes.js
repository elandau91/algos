//Problem Solving Patterns

    //"Frequency Counters"
        //Not a real name, but this pattern uses objects to collect sets of values
        //and frequencies from different data types. Essentially counting up the 
        //frequency of occurences to verify true or false.
        //See anagrams or frequency for examples

    //"Multiple Pointers"
        //Creating "pointers" or values that correspong to an index or postion and move
        //towards either the beginning, middle or end based on problem.
        //Very good for space complexity.

    //"Sliding Window"
        //This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or a number
        //from one position to another.
        //Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes
        //Very useful for keeping track of data in a an array/string
