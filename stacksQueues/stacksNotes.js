//STACKS

    //What is a stack?
        //It is a data collection. An abstract data structure
        //It abides by a LIFO principle. 
            //The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack
        //This is how the Call Stack works!
            //With function calls, they are stacked and removed like a pile of books
            //Managing function invocations
            //Undo/redoing from top of stack 
            //Routing (the history object) in the browser is treated like a stack
    
    //Big O of Stacks
        //Insertion - O(1)
        //Removal - O(1)
        //Searching - O(n)
        //Access - O(n)
            //Stacks are all about insertion and removal. If you need searching or access, you should probably use something else
