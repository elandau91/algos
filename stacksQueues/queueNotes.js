//QUEUES

    //What is a queue?
        //It's very similar to stack, but the datastruce is different.
        //Queues are FIFO
            //This mean first in, first out
                //Queue for joining a video game online
                //Background tasks on the computer, downloading something, uploading something (depending on file size) etc...
                //Print queue! What you want to print first
    
    //They can be implemented as an array or a Class

    //Big O of Queue
        //Insertion - O(1)
        //Removal - O(1)
        //Searching - O(n)
        //Access - O(n)
            //Queues are all about insertion and removal (if you use classes not arrays). If you need searching or access, you should probably use something else
